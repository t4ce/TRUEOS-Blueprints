/// Trait for autonomous objects that receive lifecycle callbacks.
///
/// Actors are registered in an [`ActorRegistry`] and are driven by
/// [`TickLoop`](https://docs.rs/pulsar_game/latest/pulsar_game/tick/struct.TickLoop.html).
/// Each actor is backed by a single entity in the [`World`].
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// 1. `begin_play` â€” called once when registered (after the world is ready).
/// 2. `tick` — called every frame (time-free; see `tick`).
/// 3. `end_play` â€” called once on deregistration or shutdown.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use pulsar_scenedb::{Actor, World, Entity};
///
/// struct Player;
///
/// impl Actor for Player {
///     fn begin_play(&mut self, entity: Entity, world: &mut World) {
///         // Spawn child entities, attach components, etc.
///     }
///     fn tick(&mut self, entity: Entity, world: &mut World) {
///         // Read input, apply movement, etc.
///     }
///     fn end_play(&mut self, entity: Entity, world: &mut World) {
///         // Clean up resources.
///     }
/// }
/// ```
