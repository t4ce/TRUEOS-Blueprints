//! Distributed state vector backend.
//!
//! Splits the `2^n` amplitude vector across `P = 2^p` ranks. The low `n - p`
//! qubits index the local slice. The top `p` qubits select the rank. Each rank
//! stores `2^(n - p)` amplitudes in an inner [`StatevectorBackend`].
//!
//! # Memory layout
//!
//! Global index: `rank * 2^(n - p) + local_index`. If `q < n - p`, qubit `q` is
//! bit `q` of `local_index`; otherwise it is bit `q - (n - p)` of the rank id.
//! Qubit 0 is the least significant bit. `|0...0>` is index 0 on rank 0.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Implemented: local gates, rank bit one qubit gates, two qubit gates, controlled
//! gates across rank bits, `probabilities`, and `export_statevector`. A global
//! control is constant on a rank, so it gates the whole slice with no
//! communication. Diagonal controlled gates never communicate. With one rank
//! ([`SerialComm`](crate::distributed::SerialComm)), every qubit is local.
//!
//! Fusion runs in every mode. Local fused gates dispatch to the inner SIMD
//! kernels. Fused or batched gates that span rank bits are decomposed into the
//! paths above. A general two qubit gate over one global qubit needs one
//! pairwise exchange; over two global qubits it gathers a group of four ranks.
//!
//! Once a rank resolves its global qubit bits, the remaining gate is local and
//! dispatches to the inner backend. The only manual amplitude loops combine the
//! received buffers after communication.
//!
//! Measurement, reset, and classical conditionals are supported. Measurement
//! probabilities are summed with `Allreduce`. Each rank uses the same seeded RNG,
//! so ranks agree without exchanging the draw. Reset follows the statevector
//! convention: project onto `|0>`, renormalize, and reinitialize to `|0...0>`
//! when the zero branch is empty.
//!
//! # Qubit relabeling
//!
//! At more than one rank the backend keeps a circuit-to-physical qubit map
//! (on by default, see [`crate::distributed::relabel_enabled`]). SWAP becomes a
//! map update: no amplitudes move and no rank communicates, at any local or
//! global split. Before a gate applies non-diagonal action to a qubit in a rank
//! bit position, the qubit is relabeled into a local position by exchanging the
//! half slice whose local bit differs from the rank bit, evicting the least
//! recently used local qubit. The gate and every later gate on that qubit then
//! run on the inner SIMD kernels with no further communication, until the qubit
//! is evicted again. Diagonal action and control bits stay free on global
//! qubits, so they never trigger a relabel.
//!
//! Gate targets and the qubit indices inside batched gate data (`MultiFused`,
//! `Multi2q`, `BatchPhase`, `BatchRzz`, `DiagonalBatch`) are translated through
//! the map at apply time. `probabilities` and `export_statevector` reorder the
//! gathered vector back to circuit qubit order; measurement, reset, and
//! `qubit_probability` translate the qubit index. The direct per-gate exchange
//! paths remain for relabeling disabled and for instructions whose qubits
//! cannot all be made local (no eviction victim).
//!
//! Relabeling wins whenever gate activity has qubit locality: SWAP networks,
//! repeated gates on the same qubits, and working sets that fit the local
//! positions. The known adverse pattern is a cyclic scan, a gate wall over
//! more hot qubits than local positions repeated layer after layer, which
//! defeats least recently used eviction and can exceed direct exchange volume.
//! Lookahead epoch planning addresses that case; until then
//! `PRISM_DIST_RELABEL=0` restores direct exchange.
//!
//! # Communication cost
//!
//! Only gates that are not diagonal and touch a global target communicate. With
//! relabeling, a global SWAP costs nothing and the first non-diagonal gate on a
//! global qubit costs a half-slice relabel exchange that also makes later gates
//! on that qubit local. On the direct paths, a global one qubit gate, or a two
//! qubit gate over one global qubit, costs one pairwise exchange of the local
//! slice; a two qubit gate over two global qubits gathers four ranks. Both the
//! direct one qubit exchange and the relabel exchange are tiled by
//! [`crate::distributed::exchange_chunk`], which bounds the transfer buffers.
//!
//! [`DistributedStatevectorBackend::exchange_messages`] and
//! [`DistributedStatevectorBackend::exchange_amplitudes`] expose rank local
//! communication volume. Use these counters to evaluate qubit reordering and
//! routing, since one host cannot measure real network latency.
//!
//! # Shot sampling
//!
//! Circuits whose measurements are terminal sample shots without gathering the
//! dense state or probability vector on any rank; communication scales with
//! the rank count and shot count, never with the state size. See
//! [`DistributedStatevectorBackend::sample_state_indices`] for the algorithm.
//! Circuits with mid-circuit measurements fall back to one lockstep run per
//! shot.
//!
//! Not implemented yet: lookahead epoch planning that batches several relabels
//! into one exchange.
