//! Gate definitions and matrix representations.
//!
//! Gates are represented as an enum for fast dispatch without trait-object overhead
//! in the simulation hot path. Matrix representations use stack-allocated arrays
//! to avoid heap allocation during gate application.
//!
//! # Hot-path design notes
//! - `Gate` methods take `&self`, the enum is 16 bytes (Box indirection for `Fused`).
//! - `matrix_2x2` returns `[[Complex64; 2]; 2]` on the stack.
//! - Two-qubit gates (CX, CZ, SWAP) have dedicated application routines in
//!   backends rather than materializing a 4×4 matrix.
