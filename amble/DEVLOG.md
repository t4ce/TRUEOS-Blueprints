# Amble Informal Development Log

I've been looking for a way to keep informal notes on development of Amble for a couple of reasons:

- so I have a place to organize thoughts on works in progress
- so it's easy for others to see what's being done

For the *few* of you out there lurking and watching the my pet project so far, it may sometimes seem like nothing is changing, though I work on Amble just about every day in some aspect or another. Many times, these are small changes buried in the DSL, the demo game content, or updates to the companion Zed extension and language server. 

So, I intend to keep an informal log here, going forward. With the exception of this intro, newest entries will be at the top.

Soo... I started a little experiment branch looking at changing some of the key entity ID types to a newtype. It went so well that I wound up fully refactoring the enging to use newtype IDs for Items / Npcs / Rooms. Goals and Spinners still use basic string IDs, but I didn't think more was needed for them since there's no "churn". They're initialized when the game starts and are essentially static (though something may occasionally be added to a spinner) and aren't used in functions that handle other types of entity IDs much. Rooms, Items, and NPCs are used together and manipulated a lot, so it pays to have the improved clarity of code and type safety for those.

So this:
```rust
pub type Id = String;
```
Becomes this:
```rust
pub struct RoomId(String);
pub struct ItemId(String);
pub struct NpcId(String);
```
Quick demo game idea: Fur Trapper NPC shows up in snowfield with deflicted eyes -- failable goal: cure it before he wanders off.

Scenery items done for the main building first floor. Changed the way the patio bit works -- rather than alter the patio depending on sunglasses possession, I alter the exit from the restaurant. There are now two different rooms for the patio -- the regular patio and a room called BLINDING GLARE. The exit from the restaurant just goes to the glare room if you don't have the sunglasses, changes to patio when you do. This makes it easier to deal with overlays and prevents the player from seeing the real contents of the patio *at all* until they acquire the sunglasses.

Some headway on 0.66.0-pre -- more scenery updates to demo room content, but those sometimes lead to new ideas of ways to do thing or new things entirely. The whole sequence with the Vogon poetry and the panic room has been revamped. Some additional engine changes were needed as well, to fix a bug in room exit matching, to allow handlers other than "look_at" to recognize scenery items.

I've also been doing a bunch of code cleanup, addressing clippy lints, light refactoring. 

Also addressed a papercut that was bugging me -- no markup / formatting could be used in the game intro text, which was silly. It's now passed through the markup / wrap renderers like (most) everything else.

Also changed the default scoring ranks to some generic ones; kept the fun ones in the game demo definition to override it, though. 

I'd really like to get 0.66.0 out soon, but there's still a bunch of the demo game to adjust for scenery before I do. At some point, I need to go through the demo front to back and make sure all of the puzzles and everything is working as expected. It's hard to do when I wrote the game and all of the puzzles, and already know all of the answers and how to phrase things so the parser understands them. I need fresh eyes on it. The one user who commented so far made one simple suggestion that's making a *huge* difference in the way the engine/game plays and I'd have never seen it. (I never tried to interact with the "scenery" because I already knew it was just scenery from creating it... so I missed the fact that people would get jarring "unrecognized" all the time when trying to explore an area.)

Didn't make any headway on the content tonight. The amble-LSP language server was annoying me (there was an indexing problem causing false positive diagnostics, leading back to a problem with the tree-sitter grammar's handling of scheduled action blocks which was also causing syntax highlighting to fail). Worked with Codex first for a workaround, but then wound up updating the tree-sitter-amble's parsing within schedule blocks -- diagnostics are fixed along with the syntax highlighting -- which will make further work on the content easier going forward. 

On another note: I *really* wish I would have named this thing Ramble instead of Amble! I'm not sure what one would need to do to change it across... everything. I may just be too locked in to Amble for it.

# 2-16-2026

Haven't kept this log as I'd intended for frequent tidbits. So it goes.

The Amble lull is over, though. Due to a great user suggestion, scenery and conditional visibility have entered the chat. These lend a whole new dimension to the engine and help to cut down greatly on parse errors stemming from reasonable word choices.

However... the creation of that system and my injecting it into the first room in the demo has led to the "clean spot" effect... now that that room has been "spruced up" with that system, the rest of them seem kludgy. So, now, before 0.66.0 is released, I want to go over **all** of the demo game content and apply scenery and conditional visibility where is smooths out the experience -- which is everywhere.

So... I've got about 1/3 of the rooms converted so far. I opened a couple of additional issues for an easy quick fix and and medium fix on GH. Unlikely anyone will jump in and complete them, but they're small enough and straightforward so will probably go into 0.66.0 as well.

Still in a lull on Amble. Have a few ideas for engine enhancement. Also some ideas for the second demo game (hospital) which I've started adding. In the process of that, I've found a bug in the Command::Take handler that causes a problem working with items inside transparent containers. Been working on other projects and enhancing my Rust-fu while I'm at low tide on amble_engine ideas.

# 1-17-2026

I'm surprised it's been 10 days since I updated this. I've been working on the multi-game system (game-chooser branch) and it's about good to go… so I've been working on a second small mini-game-demo to distribute alongside the main amble demo, so that people can see how the game chooser works right away.

The new demo will have a more serious tone. A "wake up attached to a strange IV in an abandoned hospital" situation. 

Also been working through exercism and lessons learned there have led to use of a macro / little refactoring in the code -- looking for other opportunities to leverage that and the .fold() method.

# 1-7-2026

Tried using Claude to improve diagnostics in the language server. Unmitigated disaster. Reverted all changes. I'm surprised, after having good luck with Claude on some other stuff some months ago. Oh well. That's what git is for.

User comment on Reddit inspired me to finally add abbreviations and an easier way to navigate. I looked at a few ways to do it... wound up finding the easiest way was to catch and _massage_ user input before passing it on to the parser. Just tested, committed, and pushed it.

# 1-5-2026

It's been nice to see a *little* reaction from people on this. Taking a little bit of a breather to let the new 0.65.0 release settle. Put in a little work on the language server and some calculations in medicalc. I'll probably toy with / polish the game demo before I do anything else.

Had a comment about adding shorthand commands (l for look, cardinal directions etc) -- creating an issue for it -- should be easy to implement. Just need to decide what the shorthand will be. On a related note, maybe add room exit names to autocomplete, too.

# 1-3-2026

Inspiration wound up striking pretty hard after my 1-1 post and it led to a whirlwind of changes to the engine's data pipeline. The TOML intermediary files are all gone. We define everything in .amble files that isn't a static part of the engine. That improved and simplified the loader code in many ways. 

That BIG breaking change along with the bevy of other changes (markup, :note command) led me to go forward with the 0.65.0 release today.

# 1-1-2026

Feeling uninspired today. Looked at code to refactor -- meh. Thought about starting a dialogue feature upgrade. Meh again. I even went and looked at a couple of my other repos -- meh.

So, I went through some previous notes I made about content adjustments for the demo game and implemented them. I guess that's it for today.

# 12-31-2025

I've done some recent reading about refactoring and code readability. When I go back to look at some of the code both the engine and the script compiler, there are abundant "code smells". I spent some time doing some of the simpler types of refactors today -- renaming variables, extracting complicted logic into functions, using guard clauses to reduce indentation hell. I'm really surprised and pleased at how much more readable and maintainable these simple chnages can make the code. 

Didn't get anything done on updating content.

Also sad to say I had to lean on Codex to get some semblance of a refactor going for amble_script. It was a giant mess that had come to the point where I had no idea how it worked in many areas. I'm hoping the simple changes Codex made (mostly separating things into modules and extracting functions) will make it easier for me to get back on top of that part of Amble. If I'm ever to tackle macros (even compiler-defined ones), I'll need a much more solid understanding before I can insert that logic.

**Amble's Birthday!**
I got curious and looked back to figure out when exactly I started working on Amble. The conversation with ChatGPT about "type driven development" that led to me starting work on the engine was on **July 25, 2025**.  

**Amble work today**
Today... after doing a *tiny* bit of work on another project (medicalc) I came back to Amble and refactored the View module heavily, adding the ability to use markup in the triggered `do show` messages now. Already merged.

**Looking Forward a Bit**
After asking GPT when we had that conversation, "we" chatted a bit more about where Amble is and next steps. I think the next Big Thing™ is going to be an overhaul / recreation of NPC dialogue, so that actual (scripted) conversations are possible. 

The other couple of ideas I had (macros / meta-programming for the DSL, and DSL-definable item abilities and interactions) are a bust, I think. The first would be high effort with low impact. The second would have really high impact, but is nearly impossible to implement with a parser engine. The DSL would have to be able to teach new verbs to the parser, how to translate that to a Command variant, and then the DSL would have to have some way to tell the engine how to process and display results from it... and that point, the DSL would be getting complicated enough that they might as well just learn Rust and add it to the engine!

# 12-29-2025

I merged the content update branch (that also had a few minor engine tweaks and refactors and docstring updates). There's still about half the demo game for me to play through including a bunch of puzzle content that will likely need tuning up, but I wanted to get this `DEVLOG` into `main`, so I went ahead with a merge.

###### Thinking 0.65.0?

Probably soon. With the markup module, entity search and some other refactoring we can already call this a minor version -- but I'd like to refresh the rest of the demo content before a new release.

# 12-28-2025

- started this DEVLOG
- caught up on content tweaks "todo" notes I made with the new :note system. Nothing fancy, mostly fixing some inconsistencies with descriptions after state changes in the world. 
- Now at least the poor Gonk Droid can get his family photo back!
- this is all in the demo-game-content-updates branch -- nothing merged to main yet
- considered possible ways of making new item abilities and interactions possible to create from within the DSL / at runtime. Gave me a friggin headache. The biggest problem here is that this is a parser game engine, and the parser has to translate near-natural English to Command:: variants that the engine can understand. The parser can't be taught new vocabulary at runtime. A custom command variant would be easy enough to create, but it would have to be tied to some type of a command handler -- that also couldn't be defined with runtime data. It may just not be possible with this design?
