//! System utility command handlers for the Amble game engine.
//!
//! This module provides handlers for meta-game commands that control the game
//! system itself rather than affecting the game world directly. These commands
//! manage game state persistence, user interface settings, help systems, and
//! game termination.
//!
//! # Command Categories
//!
//! ## Game State Management
//! - [`save_handler`] - Serialize and save current game state to disk
//! - [`load_handler`] - Load previously saved game state from disk
//! - [`quit_handler`] - Terminate game session with scoring summary
//!
//! ## User Interface Control
//! - [`set_viewmode_handler`] - Change display verbosity and screen clearing behavior
//!
//! ## Information Systems
//! - [`help_handler`] - Display game help text and command reference
//! - [`goals_handler`] - Show current objectives and completion status
//!
//! # Save System
//!
//! The save system uses RON (Rusty Object Notation) format for human-readable
//! and debuggable save files. Save files include version information to handle
//! compatibility across game updates.
//!
//! ## Save File Format
//! - **Location**: `saved_games/<world>/` directory
//! - **Naming**: `{slot_name}-amble-{version}.ron`
//! - **Content**: Complete serialized `AmbleWorld` state
//!
//! ## Version Compatibility
//! - Save files include version metadata
//! - Loading mismatched versions shows warnings but attempts to proceed
//! - Version conflicts are logged for debugging
//!
//! # View Modes
//!
//! The system supports multiple display modes:
//! - **Brief**: Minimal descriptions for visited locations
//! - **Verbose**: Full descriptions always shown
//! - **Clear Verbose**: Full descriptions with screen clearing on movement
//!
//! # Goal Tracking
//!
//! Goals are dynamic objectives that can be:
//! - **Active**: Currently available for completion
//! - **Complete**: Successfully achieved by player actions
//! - **Conditional**: Dependent on game state for availability
//!
//! # Scoring System
//!
//! The quit handler provides comprehensive scoring analysis:
//! - Point-based scoring with maximum possible calculation
//! - Exploration tracking (rooms visited vs. total rooms)
//! - Performance ranking with humorous titles
//! - Detailed game statistics and achievements

/// # Parameters
///
/// * `view` - Mutable reference to the player's view for mode changes and feedback

///
/// # Available Modes
///
/// - `ClearVerbose`: Clears screen on movement, always shows full descriptions
/// - `Verbose`: Always shows full room descriptions without screen clearing
/// - `Brief`: Shows full descriptions only on first visit and when explicitly looking
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// - Updates the view's display mode immediately

/// Saves the current game state to a persistent file on disk.
///
/// This handler serializes the complete game world state using RON format
/// and writes it to a versioned save file. The save system creates organized
/// storage with version compatibility information.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `world` - Reference to the current game world to serialize
/// * `view` - Mutable reference to display save results and feedback
/// * `gamefile` - Name for the save slot (without path or extension)
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `Ok(())` on successful save, or an error if the save operation fails.
///
/// # Save File Organization
///
/// - **Directory**: `saved_games/<world>/` (created if it doesn't exist)
/// - **Filename**: `{gamefile}-amble-{version}.ron`
/// - **Format**: RON (Rusty Object Notation) for human readability
///
/// # Serialization Process
///
/// 1. **World serialization** - Convert complete world state to RON format
/// 2. **Directory creation** - Ensure save directory exists
/// 3. **File creation** - Create versioned save file
/// 4. **Data writing** - Write serialized world to file
/// 5. **Confirmation** - Display success message with file details
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Potential failure points:
/// - World serialization errors (corrupted game state)
/// - Directory creation failures (permission issues)
/// - File creation errors (disk space, permissions)
/// - Write operation failures (I/O errors)
///
/// # Success Feedback
///
/// On successful save:
/// - Confirmation message with save slot name
/// - File path information for reference
/// - Encouraging message to continue playing
/// - Logging of save operation for debugging
///
/// # File Format
///
/// RON format provides:
/// - Human-readable save files for debugging
/// - Efficient serialization/deserialization
/// - Version compatibility metadata
