//! Player inventory management command handlers for the Amble game engine.
//!
//! This module contains handlers for all commands that manipulate items in the
//! player's inventory or transfer items between different containers in the world.
//! These commands form the core of the game's item interaction system.
//!
//! # Command Categories
//!
//! ## Basic Inventory Operations
//! - [`drop_handler`] - Remove items from inventory and place in current room
//! - [`take_handler`] - Pick up items from the current room into inventory
//!
//! ## Container Interactions
//! - [`take_from_handler`] - Remove items from containers or NPCs into inventory
//! - [`put_in_handler`] - Place inventory items into nearby containers
//!
//! ## Transfer Mechanics
//!
//! The module handles complex item transfer logic including:
//! - Location tracking (rooms, containers, NPCs, inventory)
//! - Portability restrictions (some items cannot be moved)
//! - Access permissions (locked containers, restricted items)
//! - Container state management (open/closed/locked)
//! - World consistency (preventing duplicate items)
//!
//! # Error Handling
//!
//! All handlers provide user-friendly error messages for common failure cases:
//! - Items not found or not available
//! - Containers that are locked or inaccessible
//! - Items that cannot be transferred due to restrictions
//! - Attempting to transfer non-items (like NPCs)
//!
//! # Trigger Integration
//!
//! Many inventory operations trigger game events:
//! - `TriggerCondition::Take` - When items are picked up
//! - `TriggerCondition::Drop` - When items are dropped or placed
//! - `TriggerCondition::Insert` - When items are put into containers
//! - `TriggerCondition::TakeFromNpc` - When taking items from NPCs
//!
//! These triggers can cause additional game effects like advancing storylines,
//! unlocking areas, or triggering NPC responses.

/// Removes an item from the player's inventory and places it in the current room.
///
/// This command transfers an item from the player's inventory to the room they're
/// currently in, making it available for other interactions. Only portable items
/// can be dropped, and the action may trigger game events.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `world` - Mutable reference to the game world
/// * `view` - Mutable reference to the player's view for feedback messages
/// * `thing` - Pattern string to match against inventory items
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `Ok(())` on success or error if world state is inconsistent.
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// - Searches player inventory for items matching the pattern
/// - Verifies the item is portable (non-portable items cannot be dropped)
/// - Updates item location from inventory to current room
/// - Adds item to room's contents and removes from player inventory
/// - Triggers `TriggerCondition::Drop` for potential game effects
/// - Provides appropriate feedback messages for all outcomes
///
/// # Error Conditions
///
/// - Item not found in inventory
/// - Item is not portable (displays specific message)
/// - Pattern matches non-item entity (handled gracefully)
/// - World state corruption (returns error)
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns an error if the player's current room cannot be determined, if the item state
/// cannot be updated due to missing world entries, or if trigger evaluation fails.
///
/// # Panics
/// - none (expect is called only after key is already known to exist)

/// This is one of the most complex inventory operations, handling transfers from

///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `world` - Mutable reference to the game world
/// * `view` - Mutable reference to the player's view for feedback messages

///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `Ok(())` on success or error if world state is inconsistent.
///
/// # Validation Process
///
/// The function performs several validation steps:
/// 1. Identifies and validates the target container/NPC in the current room
/// 2. Checks container accessibility (not closed/locked)
/// 3. Searches for the requested item within the container/NPC
/// 4. Verifies the item can be transferred (portable, not restricted)
/// 5. Executes the complete transfer with world state updates
///
/// # Container Access
///
/// For container items:
/// - Must be in an accessible state (open, unlocked)
/// - Player receives appropriate feedback for locked/closed containers
///
/// For NPCs:
/// - Items in NPC inventory are accessible by default
/// - May trigger special NPC interactions or responses
///
/// # Trigger Effects
///
/// Different triggers fire depending on the source:
/// - `TriggerCondition::Take` - General item pickup trigger
/// - `TriggerCondition::TakeFromNpc` - Specific trigger for NPC interactions
///
/// This allows the game to respond differently to taking items from containers
/// versus taking them from NPCs.
///
/// This function handles some complex logic of validating and then transferring
/// items either from an NPC or from a container item. It must validate:
/// 1. The `vessel_pattern` matches a nearby container item or NPC (the "vessel")
/// 2. The vessel contents are accessible (not closed or locked).
/// 3. The vessel contains an item that matches `item_pattern`.
/// 4. Player has permission to take the item (`portable` and not `restricted`).
///
/// Then player inventory, vessel inventory/contents, and item location are all
/// updated to maintain consistent game state.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns an error if the player is not currently in a valid room, if container or NPC
/// references cannot be resolved, or if trigger evaluation encounters invalid data.

/// Validates and executes transfer of an item from a container to the player.
///
/// This internal function handles the container-specific logic for item transfers,

///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `world` - Mutable reference to the game world
/// * `view` - Mutable reference to the player's view for feedback messages
/// * `item_pattern` - Pattern to match against items in the container
/// * `vessel_id` - id of the container item being accessed
/// * `vessel_name` - Display name of the container for user feedback
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `Ok(())` on successful transfer or validation failure.
///
/// # Validation
///
/// - Verifies the container exists and contains the requested item
/// - Checks if the item can be transferred (not restricted)
/// - Handles inappropriate pattern matches gracefully
/// - Provides specific feedback for missing items or transfer restrictions
///
/// # Transfer Process
///
/// On successful validation:
/// - Calls [`transfer_to_player`] to execute the actual transfer
/// - Triggers both general take conditions and container-specific take-from-item conditions
/// - Updates container contents and player inventory

/// # Parameters

/// # Validation Process
///
/// 1. **Item validation** - Verifies item exists in inventory and is transferable

/// 3. **Transfer execution** - Updates all world state collections consistently

/// # Errors
/// Returns an error if the player's room or the target container cannot be resolved,
/// if world state updates fail due to missing entities, or if trigger evaluation fails.
///
/// # Panics
/// None... expect is called on a `HashMap::get` where the key is already known to be present
