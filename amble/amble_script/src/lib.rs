//! `amble_script` – authoring-focused DSL, parser, and compiler for building
//! Amble worlds.
//!
//! The crate powers the `amble_script` CLI but is fully usable as a library.
//! Major capabilities:
//! - Parse and lint `.amble` sources for game config, rooms, items, triggers,
//!   spinners, NPCs, and goals, catching unresolved references early.
//! - Compile the DSL into `WorldDef` (RON) that the `amble_engine` crate consumes.
//! - Provide AST types so tooling can analyze or transform worlds before
//!   serialization.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use amble_script::{parse_program_full, worlddef_from_asts};
//!
//! let src = r#"
//! game {
//!   title "Demo"
//!   intro "Welcome to the demo."
//!   player {
//!     name "The Candidate"
//!     desc "a seasoned adventurer."
//!     max_hp 20
//!     start room foyer
//!   }
//! }
//!
//! room foyer {
//!   name "Foyer"
//!   desc "An inviting entryway."
//! }
//! "#;
//! let (game, triggers, rooms, items, spinners, npcs, goals) = parse_program_full(src).expect("valid DSL");
//! let worlddef = worlddef_from_asts(game.as_ref(), &triggers, &rooms, &items, &spinners, &npcs, &goals)
//!     .expect("compiles");
//! let ron = ron::ser::to_string_pretty(&worlddef, ron::ser::PrettyConfig::default()).expect("serializes");
//! println!("{ron}");
//! ```
//!
//! For a full language tour see `amble_script/docs/dsl_creator_handbook.md` in
//! the repository.
