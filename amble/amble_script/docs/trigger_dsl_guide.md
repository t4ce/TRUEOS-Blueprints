# Amble Trigger DSL – Creator’s Guide

This guide introduces Amble’s trigger DSL for content creators. It explains the main concepts, shows common patterns, and provides copy‑paste examples you can adapt. It aims for a practical middle‑ground: enough detail to be productive without being exhaustive.

Triggers are really the **heart** of any game made with the Amble engine. They effectively define the rules of how players can interact with any items, npcs, rooms and how the world reacts to the player exploration and actions. 

## Core Concepts

- Trigger: A named block with a firing event (`when …`), optional gate conditions (`if …`), and a sequence of actions (`do …`).
- Event vs Conditions:
  - Event is the thing the player (or world) does that raises the trigger (e.g., `enter room lab`). (`always` is also an event that will allow Conditions to be checked every turn, regardless of player action.)
  - Conditions are AND/OR logic that must also be true for the trigger to run.
- Actions: What happens when the trigger fires (e.g., show text, give points, spawn items, schedule future actions).
- Sets: Reusable named lists for ambient room lists (see “Sets for Ambients”).

## Quick Start

```amble
trigger "First time in the Lab" when enter room lab {
  if missing flag visited:lab {
    do show "The ozone smell hints at recent experiments."
    do add flag visited:lab
    do award points 1 reason "Found the lab"
  }
}
```

## Events (`when …`)

- `enter room <room>`
- `leave room <room>`
- `look at item <item>`
- `open item <item>`
- `use item <item> ability <ability>`
- `use item <tool> on item <target> interaction <interaction>`
- `act <interaction> on item <target>`
- `take <item>`
- `drop item <item>`
- `unlock item <item>`
- `insert item <item> into item <container>`
- `take <item> from npc <npc>`
- `take <item> from item <container>`
- `give item <item> to npc <npc>`
- `talk to npc <npc>`
- `player dies`
- `npc <npc> dies`
- `always` — eventless; trigger is evaluated each turn against its conditions (useful for ambients/status).

## Conditions (`if …`)

Simple conditions:
- `has flag <name>` | `missing flag <name>`
- `has item <item>` | `missing item <item>`
- `player in room <room>` | `has visited room <room>`
- `container <container> has item <item>`
- `with npc <npc>` | `npc has item <npc> <item>` | `npc in state <npc> <state>`
- `flag in progress <name>` | `flag complete <name>`
- `chance <percent>%` (re‑rolls on each evaluation)
- `in rooms <room1,room2,…>` (preferred for ambients; see “Sets for Ambients”)

Grouping:
- `all(cond1, cond2, …)` — AND
- `any(cond1, cond2, …)` — OR
- You can nest groups, e.g. `all(has flag a, any(has item key, with npc guard))`
- Reusable aliases: `let cond radio_ready = all(has item hint_radio, has flag hint-radio-on)`

Examples:

```amble
# Gate on flags
if all(has flag quest-started, missing flag quest-finished) { … }

# Gate on location
if player in room sublevel-1-entrance { … }

# OR logic
if any(has item keycard, with npc receptionist) { … }

# Reusable condition alias
let cond radio_ready = all(has item hint_radio, has flag hint-radio-on)
if radio_ready { … }

# Ambient condition (see sets below)
if in rooms lobby,restaurant { … }
```

## Actions (`do …`)

Player feedback and flags:
- `do show "…"`
- `do add flag <name>` — simple boolean flag
- `do add seq flag <name>` — sequence flag (unbounded)
- `do add seq flag <name> limit <n>` — sequence flag with a final step
- `do remove flag <name>` | `do reset flag <name>` | `do advance flag <name>`
- `do award points <number> reason "..."` (negative allowed)
- `do damage player <amount> [for <turns> turns] cause "<cause>"`
- `do heal player <amount> [for <turns> turns] cause "<cause>"`
- `do remove player effect "<cause>"`

Item/NPC/world state:
- Spawn/Despawn/Swap:
  - `do spawn item <item> into room <room>`
  - `do spawn item <item> into container <container>`
  - `do spawn item <item> in container <container>`
  - `do spawn item <item> in inventory`
  - `do spawn item <item> in current room`
  - `do spawn npc <npc> into room <room>`
  - `do despawn item <item>` | `do despawn npc <npc>`
  - `do replace item <old> with <new>` — swaps an item wherever it currently lives
  - `do replace drop item <old> with <new>` — swaps and drops the replacement if the player held it
- Exits/Locks:
  - `do reveal exit from <from_room> to <to_room> direction <dir>`
  - `do lock exit from <from_room> direction <dir>`
  - `do unlock exit from <from_room> direction <dir>`
  - `do lock item <item>` | `do unlock item <item>`
  - `do set barred message from <from_room> to <to_room> "Message…"`
- Items/NPCs:
  - `do set item description <item_sym> "New description…"`
  - `do set item movability <item> free|fixed "Reason…"|restricted "Reason…"`
  - `do set container state <item> <state|none>`
  - `do npc says <npc> "Quote…"` | `do npc random dialogue <npc>`
  - `do npc refuse item <npc> "Reason…"`
  - `do set npc state <npc> <state>`
  - `do set npc active <npc> <true|false>`
  - `do damage npc <npc> <amount> [for <turns> turns] cause "<cause>"`
  - `do heal npc <npc> <amount> [for <turns> turns] cause "<cause>"`
  - `do remove npc <npc> effect "<cause>"`
  - `do give item <item> to player from npc <npc>`
- Player movement/restrictions:
  - `do push player to <room>`
  - `do deny read "Reason…"`
- Spinners (styled random lines):
  - `do add wedge "Text…" width <n> spinner <spinner>`
  - `do spinner message <spinner>`

Scheduling:
- Fire in N turns (no condition):
  - `do schedule in <n> { … }`
- Fire on an absolute turn (no condition):
  - `do schedule on <turn> { … }`
- Conditionally fire later, with retry policy:
  - `do schedule in <n> if <condition> onFalse <policy> note "<str>" { … }`
  - `do schedule on <turn> if <condition> onFalse <policy> note "<str>" { … }`
- `onFalse` policy options:
  - `cancel` — drop the event if condition is false at fire time
  - `retryAfter <n>` — reschedule n turns later
  - `retryNextTurn` — try again next turn
- `note` is optional and appears in `:sched` developer output.

Examples:

```amble
# Unconditional: in 2 turns
do schedule in 2 {
  do show "A faint hum grows louder."
}

# Conditional with retries
do schedule in 1 if player in room lobby onFalse retryNextTurn note "ambient-lobby-chime" {
  do show "A distant chime rings."
}

# Absolute turn with cancel if not met
do schedule on 20 if any(player in room hall, player in room kitchen) onFalse cancel {
  do award points 5 reason "Caught the timed event"
}
```

### Modify actions

Use `do modify item|room|npc … { … }` blocks to patch existing entities without rewriting the original definitions:

```amble
do modify item locker {
  name "Ransacked Locker"
  container state open
  remove ability Lockpick
  movability restricted "Security has sealed it."
}

do modify room lobby {
  remove exit vault
  add exit east atrium { hidden }
}

do modify npc guard {
  active false
  route (lobby, security-station)
  timing every_3_turns
}
```

Supported statements mirror their top-level counterparts: you can adjust names/descriptions, change `movability`, add or remove abilities, switch container states (use `container state off` to clear), add/remove exits, patch overlays, reconfigure NPC movement (`route (…)`, `random rooms (…)`, `timing every_<n>_turns`, `timing on_turn_<n>`, `active true|false`, `loop true|false`), and mutate dialogue banks (`add line "…" to state custom panic`). See the entity-specific guides for the complete statement lists.

**NOTE:** **The turn counter is advanced immediately after events are scheduled, so an event scheduled in 1 turn will appear to fire with no delay. Use 2 or more for something to fire after an apparent delay.**

## Sets for Ambients

Sets let you name and reuse room lists in ambient conditions.

- Declare a set:
  - `let set outside_house = (front-lawn, side-yard, back-yard)`
- Use it with `in rooms …`:
  - `if in rooms outside_house` — expands to the full list at compile time
  - You can mix sets and literal rooms: `outside_house,lobby`
- Currently, sets are scoped to room lists only; considering later support for item and NPC sets..

Example (preferred syntax):

```amble
let set outside_house = (front-lawn, side-yard, back-yard)

trigger "Outside ambience" when always {
  if all(chance 20%, in rooms outside_house,lobby) {
    do spinner message ambientInterior
  }
}
```


## Patterns and Tips

- Use `when always` for ambient or status effects that aren’t tied to a specific player action.
- Prefer `all(…)`/`any(…)` for combining conditions; nest as needed.
- String literals:
  - Regular: `"..."` (supports escapes `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\"`, `\\`)
  - Single-quoted: `'...'` (same escapes as regular)
  - Raw: `r"..."` (no escapes)
  - Hashed raw: `r#"..."#`, `r##"..."##`, up to 5 `#`s for easy embedding of quotes
  - Triple-quoted: `"""..."""` (multiline; supports escapes)
- Identifiers exclude reserved words (e.g., `trigger`, `when`, `do`, `if`, `npc`, etc.). If you need a name that starts with a keyword, add more letters: `readable` is fine but `read` is reserved.
- Sequence flags:
  - Initialize with `do add seq flag quest limit 3` (creates `quest#0` with an end of 3)
  - Increment in actions with `do advance flag quest`
  - Reset with `do reset flag quest`
- “Container has” reads naturally: `if container toolbox has item wrench`
- Scheduling:
  - Start simple with `do schedule in 2 { … }`
  - Add `if` + `onFalse` when you need conditional delivery.
- Errors show line and column with a caret; the offending line is quoted to speed up fixing typos.

## CLI Usage

From the repo root:

```bash
# Compile a DSL file to world.ron (stdout)
cargo run -p amble_script -- compile \
  amble_script/data/Amble/global/anywhere_events.amble

# Compile world.ron to a file
cargo run -p amble_script -- compile \
  amble_script/data/Amble/global/anywhere_events.amble \
  --out-world /tmp/world.ron

# Run tests for the DSL crate
cargo test -p amble_script
```

The generated `world.ron` bundles triggers alongside the rest of the compiled world data.

## Reference Cheat‑Sheet

Trigger skeletons:

```amble
trigger "Name" when enter room <room> { if <condition> { <actions> } }
trigger "Name" when always { if <condition> { <actions> } }
```

Condition atoms:
- Flags: `has flag <name>` | `missing flag <name>` | `flag in progress <name>` | `flag complete <name>`
- Items: `has item <item>` | `missing item <item>` | `container <container> has item <item>`
- Location: `player in room <room>` | `has visited room <room>`
- NPC: `with npc <npc>` | `npc has item <npc> <item>` | `npc in state <npc> <state>`
- Random/ambient: `chance <n>%` | `in rooms <r1,r2,…>`
- Groups: `all(… , …)` | `any(… , …)` (nestable)

Action atoms:
- Feedback/flags/score: `do show …`, `do add flag …`, `do add seq flag … [limit n]`, `do remove/reset/advance flag …`, `do award points n reason "…"`
- Spawns: `do spawn item … into room …`, `… into container …`, `… in inventory`, `… in current room`, `do despawn item …`
- Exits/locks: `do reveal/lock/unlock exit …`, `do lock/unlock item …`, `do set barred message from … to … "msg"`
- Items/NPCs: `do set item description … "…"`, `do set item movability … restricted "…"`, `do npc says … "…"`, `do npc random dialogue …`, `do set npc state … state`, `do npc refuse item … "…"`
- Player/world: `do push player to …`, `do deny read "…"`
- Spinners: `do add wedge "…" width n spinner <spinner>`, `do spinner message <spinner>`
- Schedules: `do schedule in n { … }`, `do schedule on t { … }`, and `do schedule in/on … if <cond> onFalse <policy> note "…" { … }`

—

If you find yourself repeating a list of rooms for ambients, declare a `set` once and reuse it. If you need a recipe that isn’t here, we can extend the DSL — the intent is to make authoring fast, readable, and safe.

## Multiple If Blocks

You can have multiple top‑level `if { … }` blocks in a single trigger, plus plain `do …` lines not wrapped by an `if`.

- Each `if` block compiles to its own trigger sharing the same `when` event; it carries only that block’s conditions and actions.
- Plain `do …` lines outside any `if` compile to an additional unconditional trigger for the same event.
- If several blocks’ conditions are true on the same turn, each corresponding trigger can fire.
- `only once` applies to all triggers produced from the parent.

Example:

```amble
trigger "Arrival" when enter room lab {
  if has flag quest { do show "Welcome back" }
  if chance 30% { do show "A light flickers" }
  do spinner message ambientInterior
}
```

Compiles to three triggers with the same name and event: one for each `if` and one unconditional.
