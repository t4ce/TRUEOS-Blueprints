# Rooms DSL Guide

This guide introduces the Rooms subset of the amble_script DSL and how it maps into the engine’s `WorldDef` (`world.ron`).

Highlights:
- Rooms are their own locations; runtime initializes them with `Location::Nowhere`.
- `visited` defaults to `false`; specify `visited true` to mark as visited.
- Exits support `hidden`, `locked`, `barred`, `required_items`, and `required_flags` (flag names only).
- Overlays support all-of conditions and a `text` body.
- Optional room scenery entries provide fallback `look at` responses.

## Minimal Room

```
room high-ridge {
  name "High Isolated Ridge"
  desc """A small, flat ridge..."""
}
```

WorldDef excerpt (RON):

```
(
  id: "high-ridge",
  name: "High Isolated Ridge",
  desc: "A small, flat ridge...",
  visited: false,
  exits: [],
  overlays: [],
)
```

## Exits

```
room two-sheds-landing {
  name "Jackson's Landing"
  desc "..."

  exit up   -> guard-post { locked, barred "Need to clear the tree.", required_flags(cleared-fallen-tree) }
  exit down -> parish-landing
  exit east -> two-sheds { required_items(machete, gasoline) }
}
```

Compiles to `ExitDef` entries in `world.ron`, conceptually like:

```
[
  (
    direction: "up",
    to: "guard-post",
    locked: true,
    required_flags: ["cleared-fallen-tree"],
    barred_message: Some("Need to clear the tree."),
  ),
  (
    direction: "down",
    to: "parish-landing",
  ),
  (
    direction: "east",
    to: "two-sheds",
    required_items: ["machete", "gasoline"],
  ),
]
```

Notes:
- `required_flags(...)` accepts flag names (e.g., `cleared-fallen-tree`). Sequence steps are not required; the engine matches flags by name.

Quoted directions:

You can use quoted exit directions to allow spaces or special characters in the direction name. These become the `direction` string on the `ExitDef`.

```
room shoreline {
  name "Shoreline"
  desc "..."
  exit "along the shore" -> dunes
}
```

WorldDef excerpt: an `ExitDef` with `direction: "along the shore"` and `to: "dunes"`.

## Overlays

Overlay condition lists can be written directly after `if` or wrapped in parentheses for clarity. The following examples omit parentheses, but `overlay if (flag set got-towel) { ... }` would also be valid.

```
room front-entrance {
  name "Front Entrance"
  desc "..."

  overlay if flag set got-towel {
    text "The doors unlatch and open slightly."
  }

  overlay if npc present cmot_dibbler, npc in state cmot_dibbler happy {
    text "Dibbler beams and offers a celebratory sausage-inna-bun."
  }

  overlay if npc in state emh custom "want-emitter" {
    text "The EMH fidgets restlessly, craving a mobile emitter."
  }

  overlay if item in room margarine st-alfonzo-parish {
    text "On the pedestal sits a tub of margarine."
  }
}
```

For paired binary conditions like flags or presence checks, you can group the two outcomes into a single overlay block:

```
room locker-room {
  name "Locker Room"
  desc "..."

  overlay if flag has-key {
    set "The locker hangs open."
    unset "The locker door is tightly shut."
  }
}
```

## Scenery (Look-Only Entries)

Scenery entries add room-local nouns that respond to `look at`/`examine` without creating full items.

```
room foyer {
  name "Foyer"
  desc "A bright entryway with old pipes along the ceiling."

  scenery default "You see nothing remarkable about the {thing}."
  scenery "pipes"
  scenery "vents" desc "The vents hum softly with recycled air."
}
```

- `scenery default "..."` is used when a matching scenery entry has no `desc`.
- `scenery "<name>"` adds a lookable noun; add `desc` to override the default.

These compile into `OverlayDef` entries inside the room, for example:

```
(
  conditions: [FlagSet(flag: "got-towel")],
  text: "The doors unlatch and open slightly.",
)

(
  conditions: [
    NpcPresent(npc: "cmot_dibbler"),
    NpcInState(npc: "cmot_dibbler", state: "happy"),
  ],
  text: "Dibbler beams and offers a celebratory sausage-inna-bun.",
)

(
  conditions: [NpcInState(npc: "emh", state: Custom("want-emitter"))],
  text: "The EMH fidgets restlessly, craving a mobile emitter.",
)

(
  conditions: [ItemInRoom(item: "margarine", room: "st-alfonzo-parish")],
  text: "On the pedestal sits a tub of margarine.",
)
```

### NPC State Block (Sugar)

Combine multiple NPC state overlays in one block using the `npc <id> here` form:

```
overlay if npc emh here {
  normal "EMH behaving normally."
  happy "EMH is singing a tune."
  custom(want-emitter) "EMH won't stop griping about his missing emitter."
}
```

This expands to three overlays equivalent to writing separate entries with conditions:

```
(
  conditions: [NpcPresent(npc: "emh"), NpcInState(npc: "emh", state: "normal")],
  text: "EMH behaving normally.",
)

(
  conditions: [NpcPresent(npc: "emh"), NpcInState(npc: "emh", state: "happy")],
  text: "EMH is singing a tune.",
)

(
  conditions: [NpcPresent(npc: "emh"), NpcInState(npc: "emh", state: Custom("want-emitter"))],
  text: "EMH won't stop griping about his missing emitter.",
)
```

Notes:
- The `custom(name)` form accepts an identifier; it maps to the engine’s custom NPC state variant for that name.
- Each line inside the block becomes its own overlay with `npcPresent` + `npcInState` conditions.
- You can still use the explicit form with `overlay if (npc present X, npc in state X Y) { ... }`.

## CLI Usage

```
# Compile rooms (and any goals in the same file) to world.ron
cargo run -p amble_script -- compile \
  amble_script/data/Amble/areas/bldg_perimeter/rooms/front_entrance.amble \
  --out-world /tmp/world.ron

# Lint a file with engine data for symbol validation
cargo run -p amble_script -- lint \
  amble_script/data/Amble/areas/bldg_perimeter/rooms/front_entrance.amble \
  --data-dir amble_engine/data --deny-missing
```

The generated `world.ron` bundles rooms alongside the rest of the compiled world data.

## Tips

- `visited` defaults to `false`. Only set `visited = true` if you need a room to start as visited (e.g., the start room). The engine marks rooms as the player explores.
- Use lint early and often; it will suggest likely IDs when you mistype symbols.
